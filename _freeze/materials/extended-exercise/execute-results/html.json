It is deliberately designed to replicate a real and realistic piece of work that you might be expected to undertake within your lab. There are two slightly different versions of this exercise:\n\n•\tThe first utilises data that already in a tidy format and merely requires you to work out a way of combining everything using the tools we’ve already covered.\n\n•\tThe second starts with the data stored in a common, but distinctly non-tidy format, and will require much more effort to work out a way to get the data into a usable format. It will require use of functions that we haven’t explicitly introduced and so you will have to use Google to find out what they are and how they work. This is a much more realistic situation, and one that you will encounter in your future work and as such I strongly recommend that you at least have a go at this version.\nThe versions only differ in the skills you require to get the data into R in the first place and both versions ask you to perform the same analyses on the datasets at the end.\n\n\n## Introduction to exercise\n\nAn experiment investigated the effect of diet on the early growth of chicks. A number of chicks were fed one of four different diets and their weight (in g) was measured at birth and then at every other day until day 20. A final measurement was made on day 21.\n\n## Easy option\n\nThe data are stored in text files in a directory entitled `data/ext-excercise-easy`. There is one text file for each chick. The format of the data in each text file is the same:\n\n•\teach file contains a tidy table with four columns: ID, Diet, Days, Weight\nCreate a function that that reads in the data from a single file and stores it in a single R object. The function should:\n•\tAccept a single argument (a character string of the file location)\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Answer\n::: {.panel-tabset group=\"language\"}\n## R\n\n### Option 1 - tidyverse based\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\nCreate a function that reads in the data:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r
